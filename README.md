# EverythingEverywhereHere_Capstone
My Capstone Project
Overview
This apps fetches product data from multiple ecommerce stores so users can easily compare products from everywhere all in one place.

App Evaluation
Category: eCommerce
Mobile: This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
Story: Gets and shows products from multiple stores for users to interact and compare them. If interested, the user is transferred to the original's store website to purchase the product.
Market: Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, especially those that enjoy shopping online.
Habit: This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how frequently they purchase items online.
Scope: First we would read product data from two huge online stores(Amazon and Walmart) and display to the user. The most important details are displayed to the user. Details like product name, descrpition, price, ratings, image are displayed. This results are then saved unto the device for quicker lookup in times of terrible to no internet connection.
